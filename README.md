# Chocolatey Packages

This contains my packages, both manually and automatically maintained through [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/).

Thanks to [@AdmiringWorm](https://github.com/AdmiringWorm) and the [Chocolatey Community Packages Repository](https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-packages) for the repository templates and stale GitHub Workflow. I shamelessly borrowed the work done over there and tweaked it for here.

### Requirements

* Chocolatey (choco.exe)

## Etiquette Regarding Communication

Please remember that maintainers of packages are volunteers that have lives outside of open source and are not paid to ensure things work for you, so please be considerate of others' time when you are asking for things. Many of us have families that also need time as well and only have so much time to give on a daily basis. A little consideration and patience can go a long way. After all, you are using packages that have been developed for free using time, energy and goodwill.
